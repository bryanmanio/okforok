Files and Assets for the Covid Business Directory

In this repository you will find two files to help you if you're running a clone of [okforok.com](https://okforok.com)

In order to make the process easier, we have two files available. 

1. [submit-a-business.json](https://github.com/rileyrichter/okforok/blob/master/submit-a-business.json)
2. [submit-a-server.json](https://github.com/rileyrichter/okforok/blob/master/submit-a-server.json)

These are JSON files that you can download and import straight into your own blank Integromat Scenario. See the GIF below to see how this works:

 This means you no longer need to build your own scenarios, you can now just link your accounts and map the data to make this work properly. Video coming soon.
